ID: llm-api-za72
Integrate LLM API calls for generating summaries and processing content. Implement round-trip communication where the LLM can read from docmem (via serialization/expansion), generate responses or summaries, and write results back to docmem nodes. This enables the LLM to work with the hierarchical memory structure bidirectionally.

ID: update-ctx-dq62
Add a docmem-update-context function to allow updating the context metadata (context_type, context_name, context_value) of existing nodes

Status: ToDo
ID: move-append-r26m
Add docmem-move-append-child command to move a node (and its subtree) to become a child of a target parent node. Updates parent_id and recalculates order values appropriately.

Status: ToDo
ID: move-after-b6tq
Add docmem-move-insert-after command to move a node (and its subtree) to be inserted after a target sibling node. Ensures nodes share the same parent and inserts between existing order values.

Status: ToDo
ID: move-before-5rz7
Add docmem-move-insert-before command to move a node (and its subtree) to be inserted before a target sibling node. Ensures nodes share the same parent and inserts between existing order values.

ID: cmd-parse-ihmj
Integrate command parsing functionality from the AI Parliament project. Adapt the command parsing system to work with docmem operations, allowing structured commands to trigger docmem actions like append, summarize, expand, and query. This will enable a command-driven interface for interacting with docmem instances.

Status: ToDo
ID: chat-ui-q4w8
Implement the chat interface UI components and interaction flow. Create the chat tab interface with message display, input handling, and user interaction patterns. Set up the basic structure for sending and receiving messages, formatting conversation history, and managing chat state within the application.

ID: global-ids-9xnx
Remove the docmem state from DocmemCommands and instead treat node-ids as global (and globally unique)

Status: ToDo
ID: persist-bzb3
Implement persistence for the SQLite database using IndexedDB so that docmem data survives page reloads and browser sessions. Serialize the database state to IndexedDB on save operations and restore it when loading a docmem instance.

ID: ctx-schema-85zu
Define a context schema scheme that specifies the structure and validation rules for context metadata (context_type, context_name, context_value) used across docmem nodes

Status: ToDo
ID: doc-cmds-3s3a
Enable document creation and editing through parsed command interface. Allow models to create new docmem documents and modify existing ones using structured commands. Implement command handlers that translate parsed commands into docmem operations like creating nodes, updating content, organizing structure, and managing document hierarchy.

Status: ToDo
ID: lock-ctx-9phx
Add a docmem-lock-context function that accepts a context schema and applies validation/constraints to ensure nodes conform to the specified context schema structure
---

Status: ToDo
ID: node-path-v5y6
Support @root-id/node-id syntax to reference and relate docmem nodes across different docmem instances. This enables cross-document node references using a path-like notation that combines the root docmem ID with the specific node ID.

Status: ToDo
ID: download-3ck4
Add a download button that exports a serialized docmem document. Implement functionality to serialize the current docmem tree structure into a downloadable format (JSON, text, or other format) so users can save and share docmem documents. The download should include the full hierarchical structure with all nodes, their content, context information, and relationships.
---

Status: ToDo
ID: db-mgmt-fayc
Implement database management functions for docmem instances. Add operations to clear/delete docmem documents, list all available docmem instances, view metadata about stored documents, and perform maintenance tasks. This will provide users with tools to manage their collection of docmem documents and clean up unused or outdated instances.

ID: chat-cvyr
Build the chat interface tab, creating and managing docmem instances dynamically as conversations progress. Integrate docmem operations (append, summarize, expand) into the chat workflow so that conversation context is automatically captured and organized in the hierarchical structure.
