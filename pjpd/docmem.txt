ID: model-select-mv5t
Replace the model input text box with a dropdown/select menu in the chat interface. The dropdown should contain a curated list of available models (e.g., from OpenRouter) with common options pre-populated. This improves usability by preventing typos, making model selection faster, and ensuring users select valid model identifiers. The dropdown should still allow for custom model entry if needed, or provide an "Other" option for manual entry.

ID: llm-api-za72
Integrate LLM API calls for generating summaries and processing content. Implement round-trip communication where the LLM can read from docmem (via serialization/expansion), generate responses or summaries, and write results back to docmem nodes. This enables the LLM to work with the hierarchical memory structure bidirectionally.

ID: move-append-r26m
Add docmem-move-append-child command to move a node (and its subtree) to become a child of a target parent node. Updates parent_id and recalculates order values appropriately.

Status: ToDo
ID: move-after-b6tq
Add docmem-move-insert-after command to move a node (and its subtree) to be inserted after a target sibling node. Ensures nodes share the same parent and inserts between existing order values.

ID: move-before-5rz7
Add docmem-move-insert-before command to move a node (and its subtree) to be inserted before a target sibling node. Ensures nodes share the same parent and inserts between existing order values.

ID: prompt-cache-7kad
Configure provider calls for prompt caching. Set up caching mechanisms for LLM API calls to reduce costs and improve response times by caching prompt prefixes and reusing them across requests. This includes configuring cache settings in the OpenRouter API integration and managing cache invalidation strategies.

ID: chat-ui-q4w8
Implement the chat interface UI components and interaction flow. Create the chat tab interface with message display, input handling, and user interaction patterns. Set up the basic structure for sending and receiving messages, formatting conversation history, and managing chat state within the application.

Remove the docmem state from DocmemCommands and instead treat node-ids as global (and globally unique)

ID: view-meta-4a6m
Add a checkbox to the View page that allows users to toggle showing or hiding metadata. When checked, display node metadata (context_type, context_name, context_value, token counts, order values, timestamps, etc.) alongside the content. When unchecked, show only the content without metadata. This provides a cleaner view option for reading documents while still allowing access to structural information when needed.

ID: summ-span-ubbd
Change the summarize operation from accepting a list of node IDs to accepting a start node and stop node to pick up a span of contiguous nodes. This simplifies the interface by allowing users to specify a range of nodes (e.g., first and last node in a sequence) rather than listing all individual node IDs. The operation should identify all nodes between the start and stop nodes (inclusive) based on their order values within the same parent, and create a summary node for that contiguous span.

ID: persist-bzb3
Implement persistence for the SQLite database using IndexedDB so that docmem data survives page reloads and browser sessions. Serialize the database state to IndexedDB on save operations and restore it when loading a docmem instance.

ID: py-parse-r2be
Support Python function call parsing as an alternative to bash command syntax. Allow docmem commands to be specified as Python function calls (e.g., docmem_append_child(node_id, context_type, context_name, context_value, content)) in addition to the current bash-style command format, providing flexibility in how commands are expressed and parsed.

ID: doc-cmds-3s3a
Enable document creation and editing through parsed command interface. Allow models to create new docmem documents and modify existing ones using structured commands. Implement command handlers that translate parsed commands into docmem operations like creating nodes, updating content, organizing structure, and managing document hierarchy.

ID: node-path-v5y6
Support @root-id/node-id syntax to reference and relate docmem nodes across different docmem instances. This enables cross-document node references using a path-like notation that combines the root docmem ID with the specific node ID.

Status: ToDo
ID: download-3ck4
Add a download button that exports a serialized docmem document. Implement functionality to serialize the current docmem tree structure into a downloadable format (JSON, text, or other format) so users can save and share docmem documents. The download should include the full hierarchical structure with all nodes, their content, context information, and relationships.

ID: db-mgmt-fayc
Implement database management functions for docmem instances. Add operations to clear/delete docmem documents, list all available docmem instances, view metadata about stored documents, and perform maintenance tasks. This will provide users with tools to manage their collection of docmem documents and clean up unused or outdated instances.

ID: cmd-parse-ihmj
Integrate command parsing functionality from the AI Parliament project. Adapt the command parsing system to work with docmem operations, allowing structured commands to trigger docmem actions like append, summarize, expand, and query. This will enable a command-driven interface for interacting with docmem instances.

ID: structure-3i4e
Add a docmem-structure command that returns the metadata and hierarchical structure of nodes without any content. This command should provide a lightweight view of the document structure including node IDs, parent relationships, order values, context metadata (context_type, context_name, context_value), and token counts, but exclude the actual text content. This enables efficient navigation and overview of document organization without loading full content.
