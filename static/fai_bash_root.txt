# Docmem Operations (JavaScript API - formatted as bash-style commands)

## Docmem structure
Docmem organizes documents as a hierarchical tree structure. Each node in
 the tree represents a unit of content, contextualized with metadata such
 as type, name, and value. The root node serves as the entry point, and
 child nodes can be appended, inserted between, or deleted. The root node
 is a regular node_id like the others This structure enables granular querying,
 updating, and summarization of content, supporting flexible document
 manipulation and efficient information retrieval.

## Basic Operations
docmem-create <root-id>
docmem-append-child <node_id> <context_type> <context_name> <context_value> <content>
docmem-insert-between <node_id_1> <node_id_2> <context_type> <context_name> <context_value> <content>
docmem-update-content <node_id> <content>
docmem-find <node_id>
docmem-delete <node_id>

## Serialization Operations
docmem.serialize
docmem.expandToLength <node_id> <maxTokens>

## Summary Operations
docmem.add_summary <context_type> <context_name> <context_value> <content> [<node_ids>...]

## Static Operations
Docmem.getAllRoots
