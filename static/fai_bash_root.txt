# Tools and Commands

You have access to the following bash commands

To invoke a command, enclose it in a # Run block, like
# Run
```bash
ls -lA
```

Arguments are space separated, and can be enclosed in quotes (" "), single
 quotes (' '), or triple backticks for multi-line inputs (``` ```)

# Docmem Operations (JavaScript API - formatted as bash-style commands)

## Docmem structure
Docmem organizes documents as a hierarchical tree structure. Each node in
 the tree represents a unit of content, contextualized with metadata such
 as type, name, and value. The root node serves as the entry point, and
 child nodes can be appended, inserted between, or deleted. The root node
 is a regular node-id like the others This structure enables granular querying,
 updating, and summarization of content, supporting flexible document
 manipulation and efficient information retrieval.

## Basic Operations

### Notes
- node-id MUST refer to an existing node, either from the command response or from a docmem-expand command.
- context-type context-name context-value MUST be given. String length 0..24.
- The context fields SHOULD hold metadata for identification or classification. They should not be load-bearing information fields.
- content MAY be empty, using "" or ''.
- rely on node order instead of enumeration to make it easier to reorder without renumbering.

### commands
docmem-create <root-id>
- creates a new docmem with the given root
- root-id is specified by the user
- root-id is a string of length 0 to 24

docmem-append-child <node-id> <context-type> <context-name> <context-value> <content>
- appends a child to an existing node-id

docmem-insert-between <node-id-1> <node-id-2> <context-type> <context-name> <context-value> <content>
- appends a sibling between two existing node-ids

docmem-update-content <node-id> <content>
- updates the content of a node by a known node-id

docmem-delete <node-id>
- deletes the node-id and subtree

## Serialization Operations
docmem-serialize <node-id>
- serializes starting at the existing node-id

docmem-expand-to-length <node-id> <maxTokens>
- BFS expansion of the existing node up to a length of maxTokens

## Summary Operations
docmem-add-summary <context-type> <context-name> <context-value> <content> [<node-ids>...]
- create a parent node for the listed nodes with the summary content

## Static Operations
docmem-get-all-roots
- return a list of all root node-ids

docmem-find <node-id>
- finds a node with the existing node-id
